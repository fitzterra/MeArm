MeArm control via RPi GPIOs
---------------------------

The stuff here are for direct interfacing the MeArm servos to the Pi's GPIOs.

This is using the brilliant [pigpio](http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html)
library for servo control and cherrypy as REST service for remote control.

To be completed....
